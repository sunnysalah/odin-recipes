        <h1>Welcome to Cooking with Salah</h1>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Our Mission:</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to design nurtious, cheap and easy to make meals
                for athletes to cook at home. These meals have the perfect
                balance of carbs, proteins and fats as well as multiple 
                micronutrients to help you recover optimally. These meals are
                delicious and personally made by our head chef, Salah.
            </p>
        <h2>About us:</h2>
            <p>Head chef Salah Lazzouni is a life long surfer and athlete.
                From running track in college to surfing nearly twice a day, 
                Salah is usually pretty beat up from his rough training schedule.
                Because of this, Salah decided to study nutrition in order to 
                optimize his recovery. Enter in the meals we make. Cheap, nutritious 
                and hand tested... or should we say mouth tested.
            </p>

            <p>This is my <a href="recipes/protein-rice.html">protein rice medley</a> that I make almost every day. I like to take advantage of the 
                multiple health benefits of brown and black rice by mixing them together with 
                some bone broth for extra protein.</p>
